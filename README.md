# Solution
- Developed on windows
- Ran using `java` and `javac` CLI.
- Each solution (`PointA`, `PointB`, `PointC`) can be ran using the following 2 commands
    ```bash
    javac PointA.java
    java PointA.java
    # or PointB.java or PointC.java
    ```
- The code in the `main()` function inside each of the 3 files is only to demonstrate the `search()` function for each solution
